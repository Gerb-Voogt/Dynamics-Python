# BSc. Mechanical Engineering Y1Q3 at Delft University of Technology

repo contains the following:
  - WB1135 Introductory Dynamics Lecture notes (Completed)
  - WB1135 Introductory Dynamics Python Assignments
  - WBMT1051 Mathematics 2: Linear Algebra 1 Lecture Notes (Completed)
  
Repo might contain the following in the future:
  - WOP3A Lecture Notes for relevant exam lectures (UPDATE: IT WON'T)
 

Linear ALgebra lecture 8 and 15 have no lecture notes because these lectures are dedicated to
acedemic reasoning. I might instead make a single file relating to different methods of proving theorems and 
examples if I think it's worthwhile.\

Feel free to clone the repo or make a pull request regarding open issues.
