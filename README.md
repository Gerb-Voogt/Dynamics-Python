# BSc. Mechanical Engineering Y1Q3 at Delft University of Technology

repo contains the following:
  - WB1135 Introductory Dynamics Lecture notes
  - WB1135 Introductory Dynamics Python Assignments
  - WBMT1051 Mathematics 2: Linear Algebra 1 Lecture Notes
  
Repo might contain the following in the future:
  - WOP3A Lecture Notes for relevant exam lectures
 

Linear ALgebra lecture 8 and 15 have no lecture notes because these lectures are dedicated to
acedemic reason. I might instead make a single file relating to different methods of proof and 
examples if I think it's worthwhile.
Feel free to clone the repo or make a pull request regarding open issues.
